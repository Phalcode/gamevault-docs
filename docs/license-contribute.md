# Licensing and Contributions

## License

GameVault is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) with the exception of the some components, like extensions and plugins.

This means you are free to use, adapt, and share the work as long as you give appropriate credit, do not use it for commercial purposes, and distribute any derivative works under the same license.

This also means that **GameVault is not considered open-source**.

### Why is GameVault not open-source?

While GameVault is often confused with open-source software, it falls under the category of "source-available" software, providing access to its code for exploration and modification without fully meeting the criteria of open source. This decision is made to balance transparency and protection against unauthorized commercial exploitation, ensuring sustainability and revenue generation to support its development. See [here](/blog/2023/07/13) for more details.

Before contributing any code, please read and accept the terms outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file of each project you want to contribute to.

This ensures everything is legally clear and simple for everyone involved. This also means we can monetize your contribution, so that we can keep this project alive.

## Publishing Adaptations of GameVault

Commercial adaptations of GameVault are not permitted due to licensing restrictions. However, we encourage the creation of derivatives for non-commercial projects under certain conditions.

GameVault is developed commercially, and any third-party software using our trademarks GameVault™ or Phalcode™ without our consent is unauthorized. We take measures to protect our intellectual property rights and brand integrity, preventing any unauthorized products from being associated with us.

To maintain our reputation and protect our customers' interests, it's essential for third-party developers to avoid creating misleading products. Users may mistakenly believe these products are endorsed or developed by us, posing potential issues for safety and support. As a German GbR (Partnership), we hold full personal liability for our products, underscoring the need to retain control over our brand and software.

We welcome creativity from third-party developers, encouraging them to create derivatives with distinct names like "GameVaulTux" or "GameVault Snake Edition". However, it's crucial to clearly indicate these as unofficial versions in the product description.

For those intending to publish an official product under our brand, acknowledgment of Phalcode as the sole rights holder and the transfer of all associated liabilities, rights, and responsibilities to us through a formal agreement is required. This aligns with our approach to handling contributions, ensuring clarity and legal compliance for all parties involved.
