title: "Multi-Profile Usage"
---

GameVault+ enables the use of multiple profiles on the same client. This allows you to log in with different user accounts on different servers using a single device. However, you can only be logged in to one profile at a time.

## Adding a New Profile

To add another profile, simply select `New Profile` â†’ `Sign In` or `Sign Up` in the profile overview.

## What if My Subscription Has Expired?

Dont worry. If your subscription has expired, your existing profiles will still remain accessible, but you will not be able to add new ones.
