### Are there going to be more features added to GameVault+?

Of course!, You are the people keeping our project alive after all.

### Can I share GameVault+ with others?

Sharing depends on your subscription plan:

- **Family & Friends Plan**: You can share GameVault+ with up to 5 other people in your family or friend circle using the **Manage Members** button on the [Phalcode Account Page](https://phalco.de/account).
- **Flex Plan and Smart Saver Plan**: These are personal plans and cannot be shared. Sharing your Phalcode account is also not allowed.

### How can I manage members of my Family & Friends subscription?

To manage your Family & Friends subscription members, visit the [Phalcode Account Page](https://phalco.de/account). If your subscription is shareable, you'll find a **Manage Members** button. Click it to open a dialog where you can add up to five people to share your subscription. Changes to your subscription members should take effect in about 5 minutes.

### Does GameVault+ support multiple GameVault Servers?

You can enjoy the benefits of GameVault+ on any GameVault Server you connect to. However, keep in mind that server administrators may choose to disable certain features offered by GameVault+ in their configurations.

### How many devices can I use with my GameVault+ subscription?

There is currently no limit on the number of devices you can use with your subscription. However, sharing your personal Phalcode account with others is not permitted.

### Can GameVault+ be used offline?

Initially, you'll need an internet connection to download and set up your GameVault+ license.

Once that setup is complete, GameVault+ can be accessed offline throughout your current subscription period. For those who prefer offline access, we suggest opting for an annual subscription, as it technically only requires an internet connection once a year.

### How does GameVault+ ensure user privacy protection?

At Phalcode, keeping user privacy safe is our very top priority. We use strong security measures, including encryption, to protect user data. We also follow GDPR rules to make sure we're following privacy laws.

Additionally, all billing and payment info is stored securely on the servers of our billing partner, Stripe, which meets PCI compliance standards. For more details on Stripe's security, you can check it out [here](https://docs.stripe.com/security).

You can find all details in our [privacy policy](https://phalco.de/privacy).

### Will GameVault+ support more integrations with other software in the future?

We hope so. We're actively exploring partnerships and integrations with other gaming platforms and tools to provide a more interconnected gaming experience.

### Can users suggest or vote on new features for GameVault+?

Certainly! We encourage user feedback and suggestions. While we may not implement every idea, we value community input in shaping the future of GameVault+. Share your ideas through our feedback channels, primarily on [Github](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-app/issues) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu).

### Which Client Application versions are supported?

GameVault+ features are available from the official GameVault Client application version 1.9.0.0 and above. It does not matter if you got it from the Microsoft Store or used an alternative installation option.

### Are commercial licenses available for GameVault+?

There are, but for commercial use, please [contact us directly](mailto:contact@phalco.de) to discuss an individual licensing agreement.  
Personal and Family & Friends subscriptions are tailored for individual users and private groups, but we're happy to collaborate with businesses for customized solutions and volume licenses.

### What if I can't afford GameVault+ or don't want to purchase it?

That's okay! We understand that not everyone can afford GameVault+. Developing and maintaining the service comes with costs, and while we aim to keep the core features free and accessible to all, some convenience features are behind a paywall to help cover these expenses.

If you're unable to purchase it, you're welcome to explore ways to _work around_ the paywall for personal use. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-app). However, **please avoid pirated versions**, as they may contain malware, and **do not share any bypass modifications**.

### Why is there not lifetime license?

Lifetime licenses might seem appealing, but they’re not practical for covering the ongoing costs of developing and maintaining GameVault. Maintaining servers, providing updates, and developing new features require continuous investment, which a one-time payment simply doesn’t support. GameVault+ exists to provide "thank you" features for continuous support, and a lifetime license would undermine that purpose entirely.
