Setting up your GameVault+ License within your GameVault Client Application is simple and easy.

## Linking Your Phalcode Account

1. Open the GameVault Client Application and go to the `Settings` tab. Then, click on the `GameVault+` button.
2. Click the `Log In` button and enter your credentials to sign in.

Your credentials will be securely stored within the application for future use.

From now on, each time you start the application, it will automatically attempt to log in using the stored credentials and retrieve your licenses. If the credentials are no longer valid, you will be prompted to log in again.

## Retrieving Your License

Upon successful login, the client will try to fetch your GameVault+ license.

If a valid license is found, you will see your license details and a button to manage your subscription in the GameVault+ Settings. If no license is found, an error message will be displayed.

You can also manually request to refresh your licenses using the `Refresh` button.

### Offline Usage

Once the initial setup is complete, GameVault+ can be used offline.

When a valid license is detected during the setup process, an encrypted copy of the license is stored within the application, enabling offline usage. You can access GameVault+ offline with its license until the license expires.

Your offline licenses are renewed each time you log in, as long as an internet connection is available.
