## Custom Themes

GameVault+ also offers the flexibility to apply custom themes, allowing users to incorporate designs of their preference.

A public repository of custom themes shared by our community can be found [here](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-community-themes/).

### How to Install and Apply a Custom Theme

To install a custom theme, follow these steps:

1. Place the theme .xaml file into your `themes` folder. Depending on your GameVault installation, the `themes` folder can be located at either `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages\Phalcode.174950BD81C41_dymsgn3qpfjxc\LocalCache\Roaming\GameVault\themes` or `%APPDATA%/GameVault/themes`.
2. Open `GameVault Settings` and select your newly added theme under `Application` -> `Themes`.

### Creating a Custom Theme

Creating a custom theme is straightforward. You can just create a new .xaml file based on our template and save it in the `themes` folder.
