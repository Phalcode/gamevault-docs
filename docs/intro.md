# Introduction

## What is GameVault

GameVault ([formerly known as "Crackpipe"](https://gamevau.lt/blog/2023/07/15)) is an innovative gaming platform providing a self-hosted, [source-available](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software) alternative to popular gaming platforms. It allows you and your friends to enjoy playing and organizing games stored **on your own file server**.

Think of it as your personal Steam for your own video game collection. You bring your own game files (installers, binaries and so on) from wherever you have them, and the platform detects them and provides you and your close ones a user-friendly interface to easily organize, download, install and play your games and even to track your playtimes and progress.

You can not _buy_ or _stream_ games with this app. The GameVault ecosystem consists of two main components: a self-hosted Backend Server and one or more App Clients for you and your close ones.

:::caution Piracy Disclaimer
GameVault is primarily intended for "alternatively obtained" games, such as DRM-free games, rather than games obtained from conventional platforms like Steam or EPIC Games. It's crucial to understand that while GameVault _can_ theoretically be utilized with cracked games, it does **not** endorse or support piracy. We view piracy as an improper and unauthorized usage of our application.
