# GameVault Early Access Program

## Welcome

Welcome to the GameVault Early Access Program! This exclusive opportunity allows you to be among the first to experience upcoming GameVault updates before they are released to the public. As a member of this special group, you'll have the chance to explore new features ahead of time. However, please keep in mind that these early releases may not be as stable as our regular versions. Your active participation and feedback are crucial in helping us refine and improve everything before the official release for everyone.

### Participation Requirements

To join the Early Access Program, please make sure to meet the following requirements:

- Actively participate in the designated Discord channel.

- Run a GameVault Server with the **phalcode/gamevault-backend:early-access** image. (Only use this image if all users on your server are participating in the Early Access Program and have been accepted as testers, as it may cause issues!)
