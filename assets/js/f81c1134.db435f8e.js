This release is so massive, it feels like we could\u2019ve built the product from scratch\u2014there\u2019s that much new ground covered. \x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### What\u2019s New?\\n\\nWe\u2019ve introduced some game-changing improvements. First and foremost, we\u2019ve moved away from unreliable third-party tools like RAWG and Google Image Scrapers for fetching video game metadata. Instead of just swapping one provider for another and making us dependant again, we\u2019ve built something much better: a brand-new **plugin system** on the backend, complete with an official partnership with **IGDB/Twitch**.\\n\\nThe new plugin framework is incredibly flexible, allowing users to write their own metadata provider plugins. It supports an unlimited number of providers, prioritizes data effectively, and even fills in any gaps intelligently. And the cherry on top? Users now have full control over metadata\u2014if you want to tweak or edit a piece of info, you can do so without changing the source data. Your custom edits are saved separately, giving you full freedom.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve been rigorously testing this system for 2\u20133 months, running an early access phase for about a month. While we\u2019ve optimized it as much as possible, we ask for your patience if any bugs pop up\u2014mastillke sure to back up before migrating!\\n\\n### Major New Features\\n\\nHere\u2019s a quick rundown of some other incredible additions in this update:\\n\\n- **Parental Controls & Age Restrictions:** Now, families can manage access based on age-appropriate content, giving more control over what\u2019s playable and viewable for children.\\n- **Built-in Media Player:** You can now watch trailers and gameplay videos directly in GameVault.\\n- **UI Overhaul:** We\u2019ve refreshed the Game, Community, and Admin Tabs, along with a redesigned App Bar for a sleeker look.\\n- **Halloween Theme:** Just in time for spooky season! GameVault+ users can enjoy a themed Halloween skin.\\n- **Convenience Features:** We\u2019ve added default arguments and launch/install executables to streamline app functionality.\\n- **Markdown Support:** Both Notes and Server News now support markdown, making formatting a breeze and improving readability.\\n\\n### Critical Update Info\\n\\nBefore updating, please ensure compatibility between clients and servers:\\n\\n- **Client v1.12** is required for servers running **v13 or above**.\\n- Older clients (**before v1.12**) won\u2019t work with server running on **Version 13 or above**.\\n\\nFor a smooth update and a guide on how to use all these new features, check out the detailed [migration instructions](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-backend/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1300) in the server changelogs. As always, if you hit any snags, feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu).\\n\\n### Support Us\\n\\nIf you\u2019d like to support our development and help us keep most of GameVault\u2019s features free, consider [subscribing to **GameVault+**](https://gamevau.lt/gamevault-plus) or making [a one-time donation](https://phalco.de/support-us). Although GameVault+ at the time only offers a limited set premium features, your support helps us continue making the app accessible to all.\\n\\nThank you all for supporting and using our passion project!

Unfortunately, it\'s become an unmaintained abandonware, causing frequent downtime and issues like incorrect search results and registration problems. \x3c!-- truncate --\x3e The situation peaked on May 5th when the service went down completely for a day.\\n\\n## GameVault\'s new metadata provider strategy\\n\\nTo address these issues, we\'re making significant changes to GameVault\'s metadata system. Our goal is to make GameVault metadata provider agnostic, allowing users to seamlessly plug in their preferred metadata provider.\\n\\nWe\'re also excited to announce our official partnership with IGDB (twitch.tv), a trusted video game database. Going forward, GameVault will primarily use IGDB\'s APIs out of the box.\\n\\nMore details on our plans can be found in this [GitHub ticket](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-backend/issues/258). We also plan to continue supporting the use of your own API keys and other vendors.\\n\\nHowever, as decided in our recent poll, we will be removing all support for RAWG.\\n\\n## Temporary solution: Implementing a RAWG replacement\\n\\nHowever, implementing these changes will take time, and we are both currently busy with work commitments and travel plans. So what happens if RAWG suddenly stops working while we\'re away? To address this concern, [Toylerrr](https://github.com/Toylerrr), one of our most valuable community members, had a great idea. He began developing a solution that would be a drop-in replacement for RAWG. An application that mimicked the behavior of RAWG, but fetched data from Steam instead. All you have to do is replace the url in the `RAWG_API_URL` environmental variable.\\n\\nWe loved the idea and built on it. Introducing [rawg-to-steam-redirect](https://github.com/Phalcode/rawg-to-steam-redirect).\\n\\nThe link above explains how it works and how you can use it today.\\n\\nWhat we liked most about it is that it required minimal backend changes to integrate. We have already tested this solution on our 667 games server and it works great. The quality of box art for example is much better. One drawback is that Steam does not have a lot of tags in its API.\\n\\nWhile `https://api.rawg.io/api` will remain the default `RAWG_API_URL` for now, you can switch between RAWG and the new solution at any time. Just make sure your GameVault backend is updated to at least v12.1.0.\\n\\n## Exciting new features\\n\\nIn addition to these changes, we\'re excited to introduce you to some new features that were recently released:\\n\\n- **\ud83d\udd16 Bookmarking Video Games:** You can now bookmark your favorite games within GameVault.\\n- **\u23ef\ufe0f Download Management:** GameVault now supports pausing, auto-resuming, and resuming downloads.\\n- **\ud83d\udd12 Encrypted Archives:** GameVault now supports password protected archives.\\n\\nWe hope these updates will make your experience with GameVault even better as we move through this transition period.\\n\\n## Supporting GameVault\\n\\nFinally, we want to thank all of you for making all of this possible. If you have not already done so, please consider upgrading to GameVault+ to flex with animated profile pictures on your server. We would really appreciate it. Bet you can\'t find the GameVault+ easter egg though... \ud83d\ude09\\n\\nWith love,\\n\\nPhalcode"},{"id":"/2024/04/14/","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/04/14/","editUrl":"https://github.com/phalcode/gamevault-docs/tree/master/blog/2024-04-14.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-14.md","title":"GameVault+ out now","description":"Hey everyone!","date":"2024-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"gaming","permalink":"/blog/tags/gaming"},{"inline":true,"label":"self-hosted","permalink":"/blog/tags/self-hosted"},{"inline":true,"label":"platform","permalink":"/blog/tags/platform"},{"inline":true,"label":"DRM-free","permalink":"/blog/tags/drm-free"},{"inline":true,"label":"video games","permalink":"/blog/tags/video-games"},{"inline":true,"label":"GameVault","permalink":"/blog/tags/game-vault"},{"inline":true,"label":"GameVault+","permalink":"/blog/tags/game-vault"},{"inline":true,"label":"subscription","permalink":"/blog/tags/subscription"},{"inline":true,"label":"community-driven","permalink":"/blog/tags/community-driven"},{"inline":true,"label":"updates","permalink":"/blog/tags/updates"},{"inline":true,"label":"announcement","permalink":"/blog/tags/announcement"},{"inline":true,"label":"early access","permalink":"/blog/tags/early-access"},{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"inline":true,"label":"features","permalink":"/blog/tags/features"},{"inline":true,"label":"sustainability","permalink":"/blog/tags/sustainability"},{"inline":true,"label":"partnerships","permalink":"/blog/tags/partnerships"},{"inline":true,"label":"Discord","permalink":"/blog/tags/discord"},{"inline":true,"label":"feedback","permalink":"/blog/tags/feedback"},{"inline":true,"label":"improvement","permalink":"/blog/tags/improvement"},{"inline":true,"label":"development","permalink":"/blog/tags/development"}],"readingTime":1.18,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Alper Alkan","title":"Co-Founder of Phalcode","url":"https://github.com/Alfagun74","imageURL":"https://github.com/Alfagun74.png","key":"alfagun74","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"GameVault+ out now","authors":["alfagun74"],"tags":["gaming","self-hosted","platform","DRM-free","video games","GameVault","GameVault+","subscription","community-driven","updates","announcement","early access","release","features","sustainability","partnerships","Discord","feedback","improvement","development"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Temporary Solution to RAWG Woes, IGDB Partnership, and Exciting New Features!","permalink":"/blog/2024/05/07/"},"nextItem":{"title":"GameVault Client is now available on Windows Phone 7 based on Microsoft Silverlight!","permalink":"/blog/2024/04/01/2024-04-01/"}},"content":"Hey everyone!\\n\\nWe\'re thrilled to announce that the early access phase of GameVault+ has concluded, and we\'re officially launching it today!

In fact,quite the opposite has been happening behind the scenes. \x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nWhen my friend and I first launched this application, it was born out of a simple need for a solution to a problem we thought was very particular and only for ourselves. Having a steam-like platform for game files lying on my home server.\\n\\nWe never imagined it would resonate with others or find its own place in the market. Frankly, we thought it might end up just another forgotten repository on GitHub, gathering virtual dust with no one paying it any mind.\\n\\nBut boy, were we wrong. The response to our app was unexpectedly large and overwhelming. Thousands of people are using GameVault today, and it seems there\'s quite a demand out there for the exact product we\'ve been building.\\n\\nWe\u2019re a small indie team of two and despite juggling multiple jobs, we\'ve poured our hearts and souls into this project during our spare times, striving to offer a self-hosted alternative to the gaming platforms out there.

Additionally the system is [designed to be easily bypassed if you can\'t or dont want to afford it.](https://gamevau.lt/docs/gamevault-plus/introduction/#what-if-i-cant-afford-gamevault)\\n\\n[It was long planned on our board and well discussed within our community](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-app/issues/151). Think of [GameVault+](https://gamevau.lt/docs/gamevault-plus/introduction) as our way of saying \\"thank you\\" to our supporters and to motivate them to support us regularly. To be more specific, it\'s us giving back some goodie-features that are not necessarily needed to use GameVault back to our supporters, while they help us keep the lights on here at Phalcode.\\n\\nWith GameVault+, you\'ll gain access to premium nice-to-have features designed to enhance your GameVault experience, all for a small monthly fee of \u20ac4,99 monthly or \u20ac49.90 anually.\\n\\nCurrently, these features include:\\n\\n- Uploading animated profile pictures\\n- Applying Custom Themes\\n- Activation of the GameVault Client API (CLI, URI, and NamedPipe Interfaces Used for client integrations with 3rd party tools like Playnite)\\n\\nBut there are more to come! We will be enhancing this offering with more features, whenever we see room for it, as GameVault+ subscribers are the ones, who keep this project alive.\\n\\nAll details and a Q&A are on the [GameVault+ page](https://gamevau.lt/docs/gamevault-plus/introduction).\\n\\n**We\'ll be rolling out this new product today to our early access users first** to get the product and the infrastructure around it tested, tweaking and refining it based on your feedback before making it available to everyone. It\'s an exciting new chapter for us, and we can\'t wait to have you along for the ride.\\n\\n## So what\'s next?\\n\\nWe will polish the rough edges of GameVault+ and bring it to life in the next few weeks, hopefully.

Keep in mind, this is all a work in progress, and we will announce the final release soon.\\n\\nAfter that, we will need to urgently find a solution to our heavy reliance on the [degrading and unmaintained RAWG Database](https://discord.com/channels/1100920639667306496/1134496308846137404/1217726870959820861). We are already in contact for potential partnerships with Video-Game Databases.\\n\\nFinally, we will need to do some refactoring of our client application\'s architecture.\\n\\nBut stay tuned because once all of this is done, the Next Big Feature we\'ll be focusing on will be open for **the community to decide** in [our #polls channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu). So make sure to join \\"The Council\\" to get notified and vote on your most desired feature.\\n\\nThank you all for supporting us and looking forward to seeing you all on our next updates!"},{"id":"/2023/12/09/","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/12/09/","editUrl":"https://github.com/phalcode/gamevault-docs/tree/master/blog/2023-12-09.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-09.md","title":"Join the GameVault Early-Access Program Now!","description":"Hey, Guys!","date":"2023-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"Gaming","permalink":"/blog/tags/gaming"},{"inline":true,"label":"GameVault","permalink":"/blog/tags/game-vault"},{"inline":true,"label":"Early Access","permalink":"/blog/tags/early-access"},{"inline":true,"label":"UI Update","permalink":"/blog/tags/ui-update"},{"inline":true,"label":"Beta Testing","permalink":"/blog/tags/beta-testing"},{"inline":true,"label":"Community Feedback","permalink":"/blog/tags/community-feedback"},{"inline":true,"label":"Exclusive Preview","permalink":"/blog/tags/exclusive-preview"},{"inline":true,"label":"Microsoft Store","permalink":"/blog/tags/microsoft-store"},{"inline":true,"label":"Discord","permalink":"/blog/tags/discord"},{"inline":true,"label":"Gaming Servers","permalink":"/blog/tags/gaming-servers"}],"readingTime":1.135,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Alper Alkan","title":"Co-Founder of Phalcode","url":"https://github.com/Alfagun74","imageURL":"https://github.com/Alfagun74.png","key":"alfagun74","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Join the GameVault Early-Access Program Now!","authors":["alfagun74"],"tags":["Gaming","GameVault","Early Access","UI Update","Beta Testing","Community Feedback","Exclusive Preview","Microsoft Store","Discord","Gaming Servers"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Announcing GameVault+ (coming soon)","permalink":"/blog/2024/03/28/"},"nextItem":{"title":"A Look Back and a Glimpse Forward","permalink":"/blog/2023/11/20/"}},"content":"Hey, Guys!\\n\\nFor the upcoming large UI update of GameVault, we\'re launching a brand new GameVault Early-Access Program, and we want **YOU** to be a part of it!\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What\'s the Early-Access Program?\\n\\nEarly-Access is your golden ticket to test-drive upcoming GameVault updates before anyone else.

We\'ve hit version 9 on the backend and 1.7 on the frontend, showcasing our commitment to continuous improvement.\\n\\nAlongside the usual optimizations and bug fixes, we\'ve been paying a lot of attention to your feature requests and implemented a bunch of them.\\n\\nHere\'s the highlight reel:\\n\\n- Auto Extraction and Installation of Videogames\\n- Uninstalling Games through GameVault\\n- Uploading Images\\n- Support for more Archive Formats\\n- Bandwidth Control Features\\n- Database Backups & Restorations\\n- Crash Reporting\\n- Random Game Finder\\n\\nSo, what\'s cooking now? We asked for your top three desired features recently, and here are the results:\\n\\n1. UI Redesign for the Library and Installations Tab\\n2. Support for ROMS and Emulators\\n3. Support for extra files like Soundtracks, Mods, etc.\\n\\nBy the way, if you want to take part in polls like this in the future aswell, make sure to become a council member on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu)!\\n\\nRight now we\'re knee-deep in redesigning the Library, the heart of our application. Big changes are on the way, waving goodbye to the installations tab and ushering in a sleeker UI for Library, Game View, and Game Settings.\\n\\nHere are some sneak peeks and mockups: (still work in progress):\\n\\n1. Library (Mockup)\\n   ![Filters](/img/blog/2023-11-19/filters.png)\\n   ![Empty States](/img/blog/2023-11-19/emptystates.png)\\n2.

Game Settings (Mockup)\\n   ![Game Settings](/img/blog/2023-11-19/settings.png)\\n\\nRemember, these are teasers. Anything can look different once it ships. There\'s a lot of work left, and we\'re on it. To be technical here: Most of these modern controls require us to rewrite WPF Controls from the core. On the backend, we\'re not slacking either \u2013 tons of end-to-end tests are being written to ensure our app\'s reliability.\\n\\nExcited about the new UI or got something to say? Head over to [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) and spill the beans!\\n\\nWe\'re eager to wrap up these tasks and ship the update out to you guys.\\n\\nWe also wanted to mention we\'ve already crossed 2000 GameVault users with a growing engaged [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) community of 350 members!\\n\\nAnd your donations help keeping the lights on, though we\'re not rolling in dough just yet.

The process of transitioning to the new name will commence very soon, and we can\'t wait to share the exciting updates with you.\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nBut first, let\'s dive into the poll results and shed some light on the important facts without further delay:\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nIn total, 71 people participated in the poll, providing us with valuable data to draw conclusions from. Here\'s a summary of the key findings:\\n\\n- 52.1% of the community voted against using any terms related to piracy in the app. We understand and respect this choice because it would harm our business and attract the wrong users, as we have no affiliation with piracy.\\n\\n- 42.3% of the community voted to recommend the app under a different name but not with its current name. This feedback motivated us to rename the app, confirming that it wasn\'t just a few critics on Reddit. We want to expand our community to include the families, friends, and colleagues of these people. So please, help us spread the word about the name change!\\n\\n- 36.6% of you said you wouldn\'t contribute to our app at all solely because of its name, even if you had the opportunity. We depend on these contributions to grow and improve, so we now encourage you to participate!\\n\\nWithout further ado, here are the top 5 names that emerged as winners in the poll:\\n\\n1. GameStash (38%)\\n2. GameVault (35.2%)\\n3. GameShelf (31%)\\n4. Harbor (29.6%)\\n5. GameHub (28.2%)\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, we conducted the poll without conducting market analysis beforehand. However, we recognized the significance of making an informed decision for the benefit of the community. Consequently, we proceeded to analyze each name after the poll to ensure the chosen name resonates with our vision.\\n\\nAllow us to share the summarized results of our market analysis:\\n\\n## Market Analysis\\n\\n### 1. GameStash\\n\\nGoogle Search Results: ~33,600  \\nPossible Domains: gamestash.de\\n\\n- There\'s already an app called [GameStash](https://gamestash.app/) that offers similar features to ours.\\n\\n### 2. GameVault\\n\\nGoogle Search Results: ~800,000  \\nPossible Domains: gamevau.lt, game-vault.de\\n\\n- The term \\"GameVault\\" is associated with a popular online casino/gambling application called [GameVault999](https://gamevault999.com/).\\n\\n### 3. GameShelf\\n\\nGoogle Search Results: ~560,000  \\nPossible Domains: gameshelf.de\\n\\n- The name \\"Gameshelf\\" is already used by two existing applications. One is a [Board-Game-Collection Viewer](https://gameshelf.io/), and the other is a [Gaming Backlog](https://gameshelf.dev) app.\\n\\n### 4. Harbor\\n\\nGoogle Search Results: ~393,000,000  \\nPossible Domains: harborapp.de\\n\\n- \\"Harbor\\" is a very common word, making it challenging to find a suitable domain that aligns with our brand identity.\\n\\n- Additionally, there\'s a well-known app called [Harbor on the Market](https://goharbor.io) related to Docker/Kubernetes.\\n\\n### 5. GameHub\\n\\nGoogle Search Results: ~5,690,000\\nPossible Domains: gamehubapp.de\\n\\n- [GameHub](https://github.com/tkashkin/GameHub) is a popular game library manager\\n- it also sounds like a popular adult site \ud83d\ude01\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nWe understand your eagerness for a new name, and we are equally committed to distancing ourselves from the old one. Taking into account all the suggested names and feedback, we engaged in extensive internal brainstorming, free from outside influences.\\n\\nWe sought a name that is descriptive, intuitive, and effectively conveys the purpose of our app. Additionally, we aimed for a name that is easily memorable and emphasizes the ownership and control of a self-hosted server, security, and exclusivity.\\n\\nIntroducing our new name: **GameVault**  \\nAvailable soon under this domain: [gamevau.lt](https://gamevau.lt)\\n\\nWe have already secured the domain and registered the name wherever possible. The transition process will commence shortly. We are eager to hear your thoughts on the new name. Do you like it?\\n\\n## Special Thanks \u2764\ufe0f\\n\\nWell, as you all know, this was quite a journey to get here, and we wanted to give our special thanks to:\\n\\n- Everybody who gave this project\'s idea a chance, even if the name was kind of weird.\\n\\n- Everybody who made suggestions on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) server and participated in the discussions.\\n\\n- Everybody who voted.\\n\\n- A special shoutout to @KairuByte on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) for coming up with the name GameVault.\\n\\n- We would also like to extend our gratitude to [The Selfhosted Podcast](https://selfhosted.show/101?t=2731) for discussing our app. (Brent, we are excited to hear your thoughts on the new name from a marketing standpoint \ud83d\ude1c)\\n\\n- Last but not least, thank you to [The Self-Hosted Newsletter](https://selfh.st/newsletter/2023-07-07/) for mentioning our release.\\n\\nThank you all for your continued support!\\n\\nWe will keep you updated as the transition unfolds.

This means that our code is open for you to explore and modify, but it doesn\'t fully meet all the criteria of being considered open-source. I want to take a moment to explain what open-source truly means and why we\'ve taken a slightly different approach.\\n\\nAccording to the widely recognized definitions, [\\"open-source\\"](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) software, as one would think, not only provides access to the source code but also offers certain freedoms to its users. It allows them to use, modify, and distribute the software freely, even for commercial purposes.\\n\\nFor a self-hosted app like GameVault, we believe it\'s crucual to disclose the source code. We want you, our users, to have full transparency and control over the software you use on your servers. We don\'t want you to be unaware of what\'s happening behind the scenes, as is sometimes the case with closed-source applications like Plex, for example.\\n\\nNow, you may be wondering why we didn\'t make GameVault fully open-source. The answer lies in our desire to protect our code from unauthorized use and commercial exploitation. While we absolutely encourage you to copy, modify, and share our code for personal use, we want to prevent others from profiting off our hard work by selling our software without our consent.\\n\\nIt\'s important to acknowledge that maintaining and developing a software project requires resources. While we admire the open-source community and its valuable contributions, sustaining GameVault solely through donations or offering it for free indefinitely is not feasible. For instance, Jellyfin, a popular open-source app developed over a decade, generates only around $13,500 per year (according to their opencollective page). In contrast, Plex, a closed-source alternative, earns a significant $8.5 million annually. Our company\'s main goal is to keep the core functionality of GameVault free, but we also need to explore ways to generate revenue in order to support its future growth and improvement. We are currently considering monetizing additional convenience features for the Client Application in the future, although nothing has been finalized yet.\\n\\nWe genuinely appreciate your understanding. As a small business with just two members, we strive to provide you with a valuable product but cannot continue to do so as volunteers indefinitely. Sustaining losses in the long term would not be sustainable, especially considering our local tax obligations. We have families and commitments that cannot be neglected, and this project is not our primary job. Therefore, please understand that GameVault may not strictly align with the traditional definition of \\"open-source\\". Our intention is to be transparent and present our perspective. Your understanding, support, and empathy mean a great deal to us.\\n\\nIf you have any thoughts or comments on this topic, we\'d be more than happy to hear from you. Feel free to share your feedback on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) server. We truly value your input and look forward to engaging with you there."},{"id":"/2023/07/09/","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/09/","editUrl":"https://github.com/phalcode/gamevault-docs/tree/master/blog/2023-07-09.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-09.md","title":"Battling Harassment and Trolls in Our App Community","description":"Hey folks,","date":"2023-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"harassment","permalink":"/blog/tags/harassment"},{"inline":true,"label":"blackmail","permalink":"/blog/tags/blackmail"},{"inline":true,"label":"threats","permalink":"/blog/tags/threats"},{"inline":true,"label":"spam","permalink":"/blog/tags/spam"},{"inline":true,"label":"trolls","permalink":"/blog/tags/trolls"},{"inline":true,"label":"negative narratives","permalink":"/blog/tags/negative-narratives"},{"inline":true,"label":"safe environment","permalink":"/blog/tags/safe-environment"},{"inline":true,"label":"racist","permalink":"/blog/tags/racist"},{"inline":true,"label":"developers","permalink":"/blog/tags/developers"},{"inline":true,"label":"public","permalink":"/blog/tags/public"},{"inline":true,"label":"creepy behavior","permalink":"/blog/tags/creepy-behavior"},{"inline":true,"label":"app","permalink":"/blog/tags/app"},{"inline":true,"label":"support","permalink":"/blog/tags/support"},{"inline":true,"label":"financial assistance","permalink":"/blog/tags/financial-assistance"},{"inline":true,"label":"motivation","permalink":"/blog/tags/motivation"},{"inline":true,"label":"GameVault app","permalink":"/blog/tags/game-vault-app"},{"inline":true,"label":"bugs","permalink":"/blog/tags/bugs"},{"inline":true,"label":"feature requests","permalink":"/blog/tags/feature-requests"},{"inline":true,"label":"improvement","permalink":"/blog/tags/improvement"},{"inline":true,"label":"success","permalink":"/blog/tags/success"},{"inline":true,"label":"engagement","permalink":"/blog/tags/engagement"}],"readingTime":1.955,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Alper Alkan","title":"Co-Founder of Phalcode","url":"https://github.com/Alfagun74","imageURL":"https://github.com/Alfagun74.png","key":"alfagun74","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Battling Harassment and Trolls in Our App Community","authors":["alfagun74"],"tags":["harassment","blackmail","threats","spam","trolls","negative narratives","safe environment","racist","developers","public","creepy behavior","app","support","financial assistance","motivation","GameVault app","bugs","feature requests","improvement","success","engagement"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"A Closer Look at GameVaults \'Source-Available\' Nature","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/13/"},"nextItem":{"title":"Choosing a New, Family-Friendly Name for this project!","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/08/"}},"content":"Hey folks,\\n\\nWe have an important update to share with you all while our poll is in progress.

Even a small contribution of five bucks on [Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/phalcode) would go a long way in helping us maintain our motivation and dedication.
