While we admire the open-source community and its valuable contributions, sustaining Crackpipe solely through donations or offering it for free indefinitely is not feasible.

In contrast, Plex, a closed-source alternative, earns a significant $8.5 million annually. Our company's main goal is to keep the core functionality of Crackpipe free, but we also need to explore ways to generate revenue in order to support its future growth and improvement. We are currently considering monetizing additional convenience features for the Client Application in the future, although nothing has been finalized yet."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,'We genuinely appreciate your understanding.

Therefore, please understand that Crackpipe may not strictly align with the traditional definition of "open-source," and we no longer characterize it as such. Our intention is to be transparent and present our perspective. Your understanding, support, and empathy mean a great deal to us.'),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"If you have any thoughts or comments on this topic, we'd be more than happy to hear from you.
