**Hello, GameVault Community!**

After six months of hard work, we’re beyond excited to unveil our biggest update yet: **GameVault Client v1.12** and **GameVault Server v13**! This release is so massive, it feels like we could’ve built the product from scratch—there’s that much new ground covered. <!-- truncate -->

### What’s New?

We’ve introduced some game-changing improvements. First and foremost, we’ve moved away from unreliable third-party tools like RAWG and Google Image Scrapers for fetching video game metadata. Instead of just swapping one provider for another and making us dependant again, we’ve built something much better: a brand-new **plugin system** on the backend, complete with an official partnership with **IGDB/Twitch**.

The new plugin framework is incredibly flexible, allowing users to write their own metadata provider plugins. It supports an unlimited number of providers, prioritizes data effectively, and even fills in any gaps intelligently. And the cherry on top? Users now have full control over metadata—if you want to tweak or edit a piece of info, you can do so without changing the source data. Your custom edits are saved separately, giving you full freedom.

We’ve been rigorously testing this system for 2-3 months, running an early access phase for about a month. While we’ve optimized it as much as possible, we ask for your patience if any bugs pop up—mastillke sure to back up before migrating!

### Major New Features

Here’s a quick rundown of some other incredible additions in this update:

- **Parental Controls & Age Restrictions:** Now, families can manage access based on age-appropriate content, giving more control over what’s playable and viewable for children.
- **Built-in Media Player:** You can now watch trailers and gameplay videos directly in GameVault.
- **UI Overhaul:** We’ve refreshed the Game, Community, and Admin Tabs, along with a redesigned App Bar for a sleeker look.
- **Halloween Theme:** Just in time for spooky season! GameVault+ users can enjoy a themed Halloween skin.
- **Convenience Features:** We’ve added default arguments and launch/install executables to streamline app functionality.
- **Markdown Support:** Both Notes and Server News now support markdown, making formatting a breeze and improving readability.

### Critical Update Info

Before updating, please ensure compatibility between clients and servers:

- **Client v1.12** is required for servers running **v13 or above**.
- Older clients (**before v1.12**) won’t work with server running on **Version 13 or above**.
