Hey folks,

Great news. We've successfully migrated our App name in its entirety and will resume advertising as soon as it's published on the Microsoft Store.

Just a heads up, there might be a surge of new users joining the Discord server due to us promoting Gamevault across all available platforms now.

You're welcome to join in and spread the word about Crackpipe with your friends, family, social network, or colleagues!

**Let's decipher the mystery behind the new logo:**

- The Box represents a Vault with a Keyhole, but it also symbolizes a game dice.
- The Keyhole represents a Keyhole, and simultaneously signifies a game piece.

Did you find the logo concept creative? Share your thoughts on [discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu)!
