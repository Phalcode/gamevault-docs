Hey everyone,

We’ve got some incredible news to share! Your feedback on Reddit, Lemmy and [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) regarding our latest release has guided us as we work to make GameVault better for everyone. Today, we’re excited to introduce some major updates along with a special offer, just in time for the holidays! <!--truncate-->

### What’s New?

#### 1. **A Fresh Look for our website**

Navigating our website is now easier than ever. You told us it felt confusing and didn’t explain GameVault or its use well. We’ve streamlined the design to make it simpler, more intuitive, and focused on showcasing everything GameVault has to offer.

#### 2. **The Family & Friends Plan**

We heard you: GameVault+ needed an affordable plan for families and groups. That’s why we’re introducing the **Family & Friends Plan** - perfect for sharing the GameVault+ experience with up to six members, including yourself for just €8.99/month.

##### Special Offer

**And because we’re in such a festive Christmas mood, we’ve decided to gift away the Family & Friends Plan for one month!** If you have a group and want to try GameVault+ out and see if it’s something you’ll enjoy, just use the code: **WEAREFAMILY** at checkout. [Subscribe now here!](https://phalco.de/products/gamevault-plus/checkout). The special offer is valid until the end of January.

### New Features for GameVault+

#### **Steam Integration (+)**

Keep your gaming library organized like never before! With our new Steam integration, you can easily sync all of your GameVault games to Steam as Non-Steam Game Shortcuts. This feature allows you to access and launch your GameVault games directly from Steam, keeping everything in one place without the hassle of managing multiple platforms. It’s perfect for users who prefer Steam’s interface and want a seamless experience with all their games, whether purchased on Steam or GameVault.

#### **Discord Integration (+)**

Show off what you're playing in real-time with Discord's Presence API! This integration lets you share your current game status with friends on Discord, so they can see exactly what you're up to.

#### **Festive Update (+)**

We have added a Christmas theme to bring some holiday cheer into the application.

### General Improvements

We’ve fixed several bugs and made key improvements for a better overall experience, including better offline handling, smoother downloads, and improved media features.

### About the Microsoft Store

A quick note: Due to new Microsoft verification requirements, updates are temporarily delayed on the Microsoft Store. However, the Family & Friends Plan and all new updates are live everywhere else. Also older GameVault versions are fully compatible with the new family plan.

This update was shaped by your feedback, and we’d love to hear your thoughts on it! Keep sharing your ideas with us,we're building something truly special together. While it's a niche product, it's one that we all needed.

**Happy holidays from the Phalcode team!**
